To test this, I will use the strongest version of the PRF estimator found in the paper -- in particular I am going to use the price moving average (price minus 3y moving average of price) of the top 500 stocks in each period to predict one month ahead returns. For simplicity, in each period I just use the In this notebook you will be able to see\n",
